				<h2>1. Services</h2>
				Clear description of products or services
				Every T&C between a small business and its customers must include a description of the products and services. It can also include services that are not provided with a contract.<br>

				Elance offers T&C templates for freelancers. These are helpful when creating the same for small businesses since freelancers take many of the same risks.

				<h2>2.Payment terms</h2>
				Your payment terms should include prices, terms of payment, interest or fees on late payments, returned check charges, and the cost of shipping, handling, freight, and returns.<br>

				<h2>3.Warranties and guarrantees</h2>
				A warranty or guarantee on your work offers reassurance, even if it is broad. If you are able to be specific on what is considered quality, note that in your T&C.<br>

				Warranties and guarantees should also contain time limits. You do not want a refund request five years after providing a product or service. Choose a timeline reasonable for your industry, like 30 days or even 12 months.<br>

				<h2>4.Liability limitations</h2>
				It is not always appropriate to offer a warranty or guarantee. Industries where the chance of facing liability is high may decide not to include those terms.

				<h2>5.Refund or return policies</h2>
				Retail establishments normally maintain separate return or refund policies. Ecommerce sites usually give this policy its own webpage.<br>
				If you sell products online, you can place these policies in your T&C too.<br>
				Sometimes a return or return policy indicates that these are not options. You find this more often with service contracts.
